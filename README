This is a Parser for analyzing mobile traces such as the ones uploaded in 
Experiment 2. Here's how we run the program:

1. Download the code for parser_trace.py and save it as any filename
   (e.g parser_trace.py) with a .py extension
2. Install Python 2.5+ (but not Python 3.0) on your machine
3. Run the program as:

$>python parser_trace.py
